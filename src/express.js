  Creating an ESM package and using it in an ESM environment works seamlessly,

  solutions are:
  
  - Dropping support for CJS entirely, as some package authors are doing,
  - Transpiling and exporting both ESM and CJS files, which adds extra scripts 
    and tools to the package setup, or
  - Continuing to use CJS.

  The last option minimizes complexity and maximizes compatibility. Therefore,

  Now, letâ€™s define a tiny helper. In order to support path parameters but to 
  also keep the logic as simple as possible, there will be no support for named 
  path parameters. That avoids the need to do complex parsing of the request 
  URL. Node 23.8 comes with URLPattern built in, but let's skip that feature for 
  now as it is still experimental.
  
  To match the Express API, strings can be used to define static paths, and 
  regular expressions with capture groups can be used to define dynamic routes:

  app.get("/path") // This is a static path that will fully match or not.
  app.get("/id/(\\d+)") // This is equivalent to `/id/:number(\\d+)`.
  app.get(/\/id\/(\d+)/) // Regular expressions can be used too.

  If a string is provided, it will be transformed into a regular expression. 
  Then the regular expression will be used as is to match the request URL. In 
  either case, anchors (`^` and `$`) are added to enforce exact matches. If 
  anchors are provided manually, errors may occur. Avoid doing that.
  
  This function will be needed later when defining `app.get()`, but it serves as 
  a good starting point for discussing supported features and limitations.
*/

/**
 * @param {string|RegExp} path - The route path or regular expression
 * @returns The complete regular expression to use to check the request URLs
 */
const pathToRegExp = (path) =>
  path instanceof RegExp
    ? new RegExp(`^${path.source}$`, path.flags)
    : new RegExp(`^${path}$`);

/*
  Another little helper to define is an error handler that will be called when 
  no routes match the current request. It will allow sending a response to the
  caller, no matter what.

  Note: If a middleware sends the response headers and throws, any error
  handler that tries to send the headers again will also fail. This function, as 
  the last one that will handle the request if everything else fails, has to 
  consider that scenario. Be careful when writing middleware and avoid those
  traps.

    res.writeHead(500);
    res.end("Internal Server Error");

/*
  Note: Connect/Express uses to manage 404 and 500 errors by responding with an 
  HTML page with details about the errors. For simplicity, we are not doing 
  that, even though this represents a departure from the Express API behavior.

  At the heart of Connect/Express is the management of routes and middleware. 
  Each route may be handled by one or more middleware functions. These functions 
  can handle the request and send a response themselves or pass control to the 
  next middleware by calling `next`. If `next` is called with an error, the 
  error-handling middleware is invoked instead:

  middleware1 --next()--> middleware2 --next()--> middleware3
  middleware1 --next(err)--> errorHandler1

  To support that route-to-middleware relation, let's define a `Route` 
  structure.

/**

 * @property {string} [method] - The HTTP method - will match any if not defined
 * @property {Middleware|ErrorHandler} middleware - The list of middleware
 * @property {RegExp} regexp - The regular expression to match the route's path
 */

/*
  Once the application routes are defined by associating the paths to middleware
  functions, it is time to implement the logic that will do the pattern 
  matching and sequence the middleware calls; The `callMiddleware` function.

  The function will resolve the problem recursively. If a route matches and 
  the middleware handles the request, the logic stops there. If not, the 
  middleware returns the control to `callMiddleware` by calling `next` and it 
  will continue the recursion with the remaining routes until no more routes are 
  available.

  As the routes are a flat list of route-to-middleware pairs, the logic of this 
  function is much simpler than in v3 of `not-express`, where each route 
  contained a list of middleware. In that case, two recursion loops were needed.
  As a downside, having such a simple routing structure does not allow 
  supporting calls like `next('route')`. There may be a way to support that with
  not much more code but since I needed to use that, I assume it is a feature we
  can simply skip.

    the routes not yet explored and keep proper track of the errors that were 
    previously thrown, if any.

    Note: This behavior matches Express in the happy-path and basic 
    error-handling scenarios. However, it does not support more complex cases

    contain the path parameters. These parameters are immediately assigned to 
    the `req` object. This also aligns with how Express handles routes defined 
    with regular expressions.

    Note: Parsing of the URL is done using a dummy "base". This allows using the 
    built-in URL parser, which is secure and performant, and avoids the need to 
    code a parser here or use an external package for that purpose.

    Of course, if there is no match, the process restarts with the next route.

    Finally, and before calling the middleware to handle the request, we must
    parse the query parameters. These are converted to an object and assigned to 
    the `req` object too, matching the Express API.

    If we are handling an error, we should only call error handlers. If there 
    are no errors, and the function is a standard middleware, we should simply 
    call `fn(req, res, next)`. In any other case, we have a mismatch type so we
    just skip to the next middleware.

    Since the middleware is provided by the user, it may fail. It will fail! So
    everything must be wrapped in a try/catch block. When an error is thrown, we
    can initiate the standard error handling mechanism by calling `next(err)`.

    Note: The errors thrown asynchronously will not be captured and will most 
    likely prevent any response from being sent to the client. This behavior is 
    consistent with [older versions of] Express, so don't feel bad about it. 
    Capturing errors thrown asynchronously is possible but complex. Again, be 
    responsible and write your middleware properly so I can keep this code 
    simple!
